# Outstanding Issues #

OPS is far from complete. Outstanding Issues and shortcomings include:

  * C++ Core only works for Windows (Visual Studio Compilers)
  * Documentation is Poor, there is no API docs
  * UDP and TCP Transport are not fully implemented and functional
  * C# support has been dropped until API:s stabilize
  * OPS has no active community (it is maintained by one person only at the time being)
  * OPS needs more users
  * Java Performance could improve, it is now suffering a bit from C++ optimizations, this is especially true for large messages.

To solve these and other issues and make OPS better, help is required. Please file Issue reports and send in Patches.
