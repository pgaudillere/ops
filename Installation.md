# OPS â€“ Installation (Windows XP) #

## Set Up Your Environment ##
> Make sure you have a Java SE Development Kit (JDK, version 5 or higher) installed on
> your system. The tools you use to create systems with OPS are all running in Java and
> use the Java compiler to generate pre-compiled code to use for debugging. If you know
> you will only use OPS for C++ and C# and do not need any debugging capabilities, it may
> be sufficient to only have a Java runtime environment installed. It is strongly
> recommended to install a JDK though.
> If you do not have a JDK installed on your system follow these steps:
  1. Download the latest JDK from java.sun.com, (Tip! Select a bundle with Netbeans and you are ready to open the OPS sample Netbeans Java projects!)       http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
  1. Install it, you will need administrator rights on your system.
  1. When installed, add the newly created directory
> > "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk.jdk.version\bin" to your user environment variable
> > called path, you can do this without being an administrator of your system.
## Download OPS Binaries ##

> Go to [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/ops/downloads/list) to get the latest
> binaries for the languages you want to use OPS with. You will also need the
> latest Tools. Unpack all the zip files you downloaded directly under a common
> directory (E.g. C:\OPS\, this directory will be referred to as OPS\_DIR from here on).

> After unpacking the zip files, make sure your directory structure looks as follows:

  * OPS\_DIR
    * C++
    * Examples
    * Java
    * Tools

## Run the IDL Builder and Build TestAll Example Project ##
> Open OPS IDL Builder, from OPS\_DIR\Tools\OPS IDL Builder\bin\ops\_idl\_builder\_nb.exe
> Use the OPS IDL Builder to open TestAll sample IDL project (File->Open
> Project...browse to OPS\_DIR\Examples\TestAll, check open as main project and
> click Open Project.).

> Once open, expand "TestAll" and "testall" package folder and checkout the IDL files
> making up this example.

> When ready, build the project by hitting the blue build hammer or right click your
> project and select "Build".

> When you build your project, a dos prompt will pop up showing you the progress of
> building java jar files. This output is quite verbose and it can be hard to see if it
> succeeds or not. Checkout the following video to see what it should look like. If it does
> not work, it is probably because you have not put your Java JDK on your path correctly
> and it will output something like "javac is not a command or program".

> (Note, click the video to see it on YouTube in fullscreen)

> You can read more about the OPS IDL Builder [here](IDLCompilerTutorial.md).

## Use the OPS Debugger to Get Going With Some Pub-Sub ##

> Open the OPS Debugger (double click OPS\_DIR\Tools\OPS Debugger\OPSDebugger2.jar)
> Once open, click "File->Open Project..." and browse to OPS\_DIR\Examples\TestAll\DebugProject.xml
> To the right you can now see a drop down list with topics (ChildTopic in this case).
> Drag the Topic from the tree view on Subscribers or Publishers to subscribe to, or publish on the topic.
> Watch this video to see how to get some action:

## Build and Run C++ Examples ##
> Now, open
> OPS\_DIR\Examples\TestAllC++Test\TestAllC++Test\TestAllC++Test.sln
> with MS Visual Studio 2008 C++ Express or pro.
> You vill see that the solution contains two projects:
> TestAll\_Subscribe  and
> TestAll\_Publish

> Build the solution and make sure you get no errors (at some installations you will get
> linker warnings, this is a known issue.)
> When build succeds, hit run and both projects should open and start communicating.

> (Video comming soon)

## Build and Run Java Examples ##
> 
---

> Note, this instruction assumes you have [Netbeans IDE](http://www.netbeans.org) installed.
> if you haven't, you can still use the sources provided under OPS\_DIR\TestAllJavaTest\src
> to build with whatever tool you like to use. Just make sure you link
> OPS\_DIR\Java\OPSJLib.jar.
> 
---

> Open Netbeans IDE. Once open click File->Open Project... and browse to
> OPS\_DIR\TestAllJavaTest
> and open TestAllJavaTestPublisher and TestAllJavaTestSubscriber
> Build the projects and run them one by one (Right click project and select Run).
> In the ouput windows you should now see an indication that communication is working.
> Try starting the OPS Debugger and the C++ subscriber and publisher examples from above
> and see that they get and send data to Java and vice verca.

> 
---

> Note, if you see a "Reference Problem" alert when opening the projects, click "Resolve"
> and browse to the missing jar files (OPS\_DIR\Java\OPSJLib.jar and
> OPS\_DIR\Examples\TestAll\Generated\TestAll.jar)
>

> If you've come this far, you are ready create some apps of your own, good luck!
