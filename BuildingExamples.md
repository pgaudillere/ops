# Building Examples #

Under _OPS\_HOME_/Examples, you will find an example called **TestAll** and a corresponding C++ implementation called **TestAllC++Test**.

Open **TestAllC++Test.sln** under **TestAllC++Test** and build and run it to see that your OPS installation works correctly for C++.
If you have boost in another place than "C:\Program Files\boost\_1\_38",
make sure to alter the include and library directories to make the sample compile alright.
