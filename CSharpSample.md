# Interfacing OPS with C# #

Look in your folder "OPS\_HOME/Samples/SampleProject/Generated code/C#". Here you will find the C# code generated when compiling the SampleProject with the IDLCompiler.
Notice that you have four classes for every data class you wrote in IDL.

Use your choice of Visual Studio to open up "OPS\_HOME/Samples/SampleProject/C#/ConsoleApplication1/TestPublishSubscribe.sln"
In the solution you will find to projects: "PublishPositions" and "SubscribePositions". Examine the samples and build and run them to see how they work.
